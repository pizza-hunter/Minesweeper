Game is a grid of squares of length x, height y
Mines are generated on random squares of the grid
The user clicks on a square to start the game
	The first square clicked on cannot end the game, so if a bomb is clicked, remove it and move it elsewhere
Clicking a square either removes the square or sets off a bomb
A square can be flagged, which prevents it from being clicked 
If a bomb is clicked the game is over
	Highlight the bomb that was clicked
	Show all the bombs remaining in the game
	Reveal any flags which were not placed on bombs
A square should show how many adjacent squares contain bombs
If a square with no adjacent bombs is clicked, all squares with no adjacent bombs are clicked
The total number of bombs should be displayed
	Each time a flag is used that number is decreased
All squares without bombs must be revealed to win
